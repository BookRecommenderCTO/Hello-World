# Library Research for Hello-World Project

## Research Conducted
**Date**: 2025-08-03
**Step**: 3 - Library Research Phase
**Status**: Documentation Complete

## Project Technology Stack Analysis

Based on the business requirements and user stories, this Hello-World project requires:
1. A simple web server to serve "Hello World" content
2. Static file serving capabilities
3. Minimal setup and configuration
4. Node.js environment compatibility
5. Integration with Warp tooling and Render CLI

## Recommended Core Libraries

### 1. Express.js
- **Purpose**: Web application framework for Node.js
- **Version**: Latest stable (4.x.x)
- **Why Selected**: 
  - Industry standard for Node.js web applications
  - Minimal setup required for basic HTTP server
  - Built-in static file serving middleware
  - Extensive documentation and community support
  - Perfect for "Hello World" demonstration

### 2. Node.js Runtime
- **Purpose**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **Version**: LTS (Long Term Support)
- **Why Selected**:
  - Required for Express.js
  - Already established in business requirements
  - Stable and well-supported platform
  - Compatible with Render CLI deployment

## Additional Development Dependencies

### 1. nodemon (Development Only)
- **Purpose**: Automatically restart server during development
- **Version**: Latest stable
- **Why Selected**:
  - Improves developer experience
  - Standard tool for Node.js development
  - No production impact (dev dependency only)

## Libraries Considered but NOT Selected

### 1. React/Vue.js Frontend Frameworks
- **Reason for Exclusion**: Overkill for simple "Hello World" display
- **Alternative**: Plain HTML with Express static serving

### 2. Database Libraries (MongoDB, PostgreSQL drivers)
- **Reason for Exclusion**: No data persistence requirements in user stories
- **Alternative**: Not needed for this project

### 3. Authentication Libraries (Passport.js, JWT)
- **Reason for Exclusion**: No authentication requirements specified
- **Alternative**: Not needed for this project

### 4. Testing Frameworks (Jest, Mocha)
- **Reason for Exclusion**: Simple functionality doesn't warrant complex testing setup
- **Alternative**: Manual testing sufficient for demonstration project

## Dependency Management

### Package.json Configuration
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.0.1"
  }
}
```

### Installation Commands
```bash
npm install express
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

## Integration Considerations

### Render CLI Compatibility
- Express.js is fully compatible with Render platform
- Standard Node.js applications deploy seamlessly
- No additional configuration required

### Warp Tooling Integration
- Node.js projects integrate well with existing Warp structure
- render.exe CLI tool supports Node.js applications
- No conflicts with global tooling expected

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Libraries
- **Express.js**: Mature, stable, widely adopted
- **Node.js**: LTS version provides stability
- **nodemon**: Development-only, no production impact

### No High-Risk Dependencies Identified
- All selected libraries are industry standards
- Minimal dependency footprint reduces security risks
- No experimental or beta libraries included

## Conclusion

The research recommends a minimal technology stack focused on:
1. **Express.js** for web server functionality
2. **Node.js LTS** as the runtime environment
3. **nodemon** for development convenience

This stack fulfills all business requirements while maintaining simplicity and reliability. The libraries chosen are industry standards with excellent compatibility with both Warp tooling and Render deployment platform.

## Next Steps
- Await human approval of library selection
- Proceed to Step 4: Update comprehensive documentation
- Create detailed implementation plan
