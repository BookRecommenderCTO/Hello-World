# Hello-World Business Requirements

## Project Request
**Request**: Create scaffolding for a new project called Hello-World
**Requested By**: User
**Date**: 2025-08-03
**Status**: Step 1 - Documentation Phase

## Project Name
**Hello-World**

## Project Type
- **Type**: Demonstration / Infrastructure Validation Project
- **Category**: Template/Scaffolding Project
- **Priority**: High (Required for infrastructure validation)

## Business Context
This project was requested to create scaffolding for a new project called "Hello-World". The request represents the need to:
1. Test the newly implemented Warp project structure
2. Validate that the global/project-specific context system works correctly
3. Ensure that shared tooling integrates seamlessly with new projects
4. Create a reusable template for future project creation

## Project Overview
Hello-World is a demonstration project designed to fulfill the scaffolding request by providing:
- Complete project structure following Warp conventions
- Validation of the global/project-specific Read_On_Startup context system
- Integration testing of shared tools (render.exe, setup scripts)
- A working template that can be replicated for future projects

## Project Purpose and Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Validate Warp Structure**: 
   - Ensure the hierarchy and context-loading mechanics work as intended
   - Confirm global and project-specific contexts load correctly

2. **Integrate Global Tools**: 
   - Test that shared tools, like `render.exe` and setup scripts, are accessible and functioning
   - Validate Render CLI integration in a new project

3. **Demonstrate Workflow**:
   - Validate the complete development workflow, including setup, development, testing, and (optional) deployment

4. **Provide a Template**: 
   - Create a simple, reusable project template for future endeavors

## Technical Requirements
1. **Node.js Environment**: 
   - Base implementation on Node.js and Express.js for simplicity
   - Verify that Node.js dependencies install correctly

2. **Version Control (GitHub)**:
   - Initialize Git repository for project
   - Create GitHub repository to host source code
   - Ensure proper .gitignore configuration
   - Upload complete project to GitHub

3. **Render CLI and Deployment**:
   - Deploy application to Render platform using Render CLI
   - Configure auto-deployment from GitHub repository
   - Verify live application functionality
   - Test deployment integration to validate workflow

4. **Basic Web Application**: 
   - Implement a minimal Express.js server
   - Serve a simple "Hello World" message and demonstrate basic routing
   - Ensure application works both locally and in production

## Target Audience
1. **Developers**: 
   - Validate that they can use the Warp environment to set up new projects
   - Confirm workflow transparency from setup to deployment

2. **Project Managers**: 
   - Demonstrate project scalability and ease of setup

3. **End User**
   - See "Hello World" on a web page

## Functional Overview

### Core Functionality
1. **HTTP Server**: 
   - Respond with "Hello, World!" on the main route
   
2. **Static Content Serving**: 
   - Serve basic HTML content from a static directory

3. **Development Workflow Validation**:
   - Validate setup, startup, development, and testing phases
   - Validate global tooling integration and usage

## Success Indicators
1. **Project setup follows Warp conventions**
2. **Essential functionality works in the local environment**
3. **Global tools integrate seamlessly**
4. **Development phases completed successfully**
5. **Documentation aligns with Warp standards**
